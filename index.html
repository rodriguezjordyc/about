            <p>My name is Jordy Rodriguez. I graduated from Harvard College, where I majored in political science (technology science focus) and discovered my passion for solving social problems with people-centered solutions. My academic pursuits trained me to critically evaluate the existing paradigms around technology deployment and how they may test American values.</p>
            <p>My professional experiences forged me into a generalist, but I enjoy supporting growing technology businesses build and execute their go-to-market operations. My roles at both large companies and startups taught me the importance of bridging strategy with the client experience - the space where GTM teams live. I’ve been a member of technical and client-facing teams, helping me effectively communicate cross-functionally.</p>
            <p>I keep up with psychology and demographic trends and am currently trying to understand how human-AI interaction is changing the way we socialize. I’m an active weightlifter, 5K runner and espresso connoisseur.</p>
            <p>I always have time to talk about my faith, Real Madrid, F1 and music. I'm a practicing Christian.</p>
